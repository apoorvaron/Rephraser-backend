Welcome to the README for Rephrase AI! This repository contains a JavaScript-based application with ESLint set up for linting and testing.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash

## Usage

- **Running the App:**

    To start the app, use the following command:

    ```bash

    ```

    This will launch the development server and open the app in your default web browser.

- **Running Tests:**

    To run tests, execute the following command:

## Folder Structure

- `src/`: Contains the application's source code.
- `tests/`: Houses the test files.
- `public/`: Holds static assets served by the development server.
