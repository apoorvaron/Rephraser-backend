# Rephrase AI README

Welcome to the Rephrase AI README! This repository hosts a JavaScript-based application with ESLint configured for code linting and testing.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure that you have Node.js installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

1. *Clone the Repository:*

    bash
    git clone https://github.com/BlazikenTech/RephraseAI-backend.git
    cd RephraseAI-backend
    

2. *Install Dependencies:*

    bash
    npm install
    

## Usage

- *Running the Application:*

    To launch the app, execute the following command:

    bash
    npm start
    

    This will initiate the development server and open the app in your default web browser.

- *Running Tests:*

    To run tests, use this command:

    bash
    npm test
    

- *Linting with ESLint:*

    To perform code linting using ESLint, use the following command:

    bash
    npm run lint
    

    This will analyze your code for linting errors and warnings.

## Configuration

The configuration for ESLint can be found in the `.eslintrc.js` file. You can modify this file to adapt linting rules according to your project's specific needs.

## Folder Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code of the application.
- `tests/`: Holds the test files.
- `public/`: Stores static assets served by the development server.

## Contributing

Contributions are encouraged! If you wish to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature-new-feature`.
3. Apply your changes and commit them: `git commit -m 'Add new feature'`.
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature-new-feature`.
5. Open a pull request.

Kindly adhere to the coding style, ensure that tests pass, and keep linting errors to a minimum.

## Adding Your .env File

To add your own `.env` file for sensitive data, follow these steps:

1. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.
2. Inside the `.env` file, define your environment variables like this:

    plaintext
    DB_USER=your_db_user
    DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_PORT=5432
    DB_NAME=your_db_name
    

3. Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual database credentials.
4. Remember not to commit your `.env` file to version control by adding it to the `.gitignore` file.
